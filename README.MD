This is a java program that indexed a full crawl of the .co.nz domain in an I/O efficient way and used the generated index to answer boolean AND queries.
Primary features include Delta encoding and VarByte compression, Conjunctive Document-at-a-time query processing, I/O efficient indexing and query processing 
and LRU caching of results for more responsive frequent query results.
